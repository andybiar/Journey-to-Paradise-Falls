Journey to Paradise Falls
==

Journey to Paradise Falls was an installation in the Sigma Phi Epsilon Up Booth at Carnegie Mellon University Spring Carnival 2013. Check it out on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/73481757).

If you want to learn more, I made a 36-minute [documentary film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPBguBjDEkM) about the construction of the Up Booth. It's pretty good!
